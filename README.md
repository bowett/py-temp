# py-temp

This is a hobby project for buidling a temperature sensor with a raspberry pi.

Already Implemented
-------------------
Read the temperature from the probe.
Send the data to be collected and charted in thingspeak [https://thingspeak.com]

Plans
-----
Write a blog post about how I built the set up.
Store the data locally in log files (maybe database too).
Sync to cloud storage for future analysis.
